### COURSE DESCRIPTION
Data Structures and Algorithms II explores the analysis and implementation of high-performance data structures and supporting algorithms, 
including graphs, hashing, self-adjusting data structures, set representations, and dynamic programming. The course also introduces students 
to NP-complete problems. The course discusses how to use Python techniques to implement software solutions for problems of memory management 
and data compression. This course has two prerequisites: Data Structures and Algorithms I and Discrete Math II.

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
Several project parameters were set regarding when packages could arrive, which trucks some packages could be loaded onto, and which data 
structures could be used in certain areas of the application. The final requirement was that all 40 packages would be delivered according
to the delivery specifications while staying under a combined 140 miles traveled for the 3 available delivery trucks. The project also 
required students to construct a hash table without using dictionaries, to create a UI with several functions to look up package and truck 
statuses, and to choose and implement a self-adjusting heuristic algorithm to route the truck deliveries.
